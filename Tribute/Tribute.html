            Mahatma Gandhi, born on October 2, 1869, in Porbandar, Gujarat, India, was a leader of the Indian independence movement 
            against British rule. His philosophy of nonviolent resistance played a key role in India's struggle for freedom.
        </p>
        <p>
            Gandhi led various campaigns for civil rights, social reforms, and the end of untouchability in India. His famous Salt March 
            in 1930 and the philosophy of Satyagraha (nonviolent resistance) left a lasting impact on the world.
        </p>
        <p>
            Key events in Mahatma Gandhi's life include the Champaran and Kheda Satyagrahas, the Non-Cooperation Movement, and the Quit 
            India Movement. He was imprisoned several times for his activism but remained steadfast in his commitment to nonviolence.
        </p>
        <p>
            Some of Mahatma Gandhi's notable quotes include:
        </p>
        <blockquote><b>
            "Be the change that you wish to see in the world."
            <br>
            "The best way to find yourself is to lose yourself in the service of others."
            <br>
            "An eye for an eye only ends up making the whole world blind."
        </b>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
            Mahatma Gandhi's legacy extends beyond India's independence. His ideas of peace, tolerance, and harmony remain relevant globally, 
            serving as a guide for those advocating for justice and equality.
